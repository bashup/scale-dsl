# Available modules (uncomment to use):

dk use: cram              # run tests using the "cram" functional test tool
dk use: entr-watch        # watch files and re-run tests or other commands
dk use: shell-console     # make the "console" command enter a subshell
dk use: bash32            # enable doing tests/console/etc. in bash3.2 w/docker
dk use: shellcheck        # support running shellcheck (via docker if not installed)

# Define overrides, new commands, functions, etc. here:

on cram_files ls README.md

before "test" export PATH="$LOCO_ROOT:$PATH"  # put scale-dsl on PATH
on     "test" shellcheck scale-dsl

on "boot" require mdsh github bashup/mdsh master bin/mdsh
